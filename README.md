📌 Overview

The AI Community Access Platform is designed to democratize Artificial Intelligence for community organizations such as NGOs, civic groups, and public service institutions. Many communities have strong goals but lack technical expertise and infrastructure to use AI effectively.

This platform bridges that gap by providing easy, fair, and guided access to AI tools, learning resources, and project management support. It ensures that AI is not just for a few, but for everyone—especially underserved communities.
